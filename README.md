# Anti-cancer-activity-prediction.

The problem is to predict a chemical compound's anticancer activity based on its chemical structure by using graph data. which consist of chemical compound can be either positive or negative in its effects on lung cancer cells, and thus be labelled as 0 or 1 so it is a binary classification problem.

The input is a graph data (SDF file) which consist of chemical structure of the compound. Each sample of data contains atoms(nodes) and the connections between atoms of the molecule(linkes).

The output is 0, 1 (0: has negative negative effects on lung cancer cells)(1:has positive effect on lung cancer cells).

Using (GNN) Graph neural network for predicting a chemical compoundâ€™s anticancer activity based on its chemical structure by 
using graph data.
